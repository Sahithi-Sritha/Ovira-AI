## 🧠 The Problem

Over **200 million women globally** live with undiagnosed conditions like **anemia, PCOS, and hormonal disorders**.  
Despite widespread adoption of period tracking apps, **early detection is still nonexistent**.

### Existing Apps Fail Because:
- They focus on **date prediction**, not health insights
- No disease risk detection or symptom correlation
- No outputs usable by doctors
- One-size-fits-all averages ignore individual patterns

**Result:** Delayed diagnosis (6–12 months), preventable complications, and avoidable healthcare costs.

## 🎯 The Solution — Ovira AI

Ovira AI transforms daily symptom logs into **preventive health intelligence** using AI-driven pattern analysis.

### What Makes Ovira Different
- Risk-first, not calendar-first
- Symptom correlation, not averages
- Doctor-ready outputs, not vague charts
- Privacy-first, medical-grade architecture
